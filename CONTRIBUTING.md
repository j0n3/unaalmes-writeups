# Contributing
If you want to add your writeup to the repo, please follow this guide.

## I know git, please TL;DR
- Pull the latest changes from devploit/unaalmes-writeups
- Add all files to /writeups/challenge/episode/your_username
- Create a pull request against devploit/unaalmes-writeups master branch

## Git... what?
Don't worry, it will be easy... keep reading!

Assuming you have not any experience on github, I will show you how to use github page for adding your writeup
the easiest way. No applications needed, just the browser. 

### Prerequisites

- You have a github account. [Create one if you have not one yet!](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- [Fork the repo](https://github.com/devploit/unaalmes-writeups/fork). 
This will create a copy of the repo in your github's user space. You will be working on your forked repo.

### Adding the writeup

#### Open to your forked repo on github. It should be https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/unaalmes-writeups

#### Create a folder on your computer **named as your UAM user name** and add all the files you would like to share there.
It can contain your writeup (pdf or txt format, please) and any other scripts or files used that you would like to share.
