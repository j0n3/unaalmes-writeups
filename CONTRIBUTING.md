## Git... what?
Don't worry and keep reading!

Assuming you have not any experience on github, I will show you how to use github page for adding your writeup
the easiest way.

### Prerequisites

- You have a github account. [Create one if you have not one yet!](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- [Fork the repo](https://github.com/devploit/unaalmes-writeups/fork). 
This will create a copy of the repo in your github's user space. You will be working on your forked repo.
  
### Adding the writeup

- Open to your forked repo on github. It should be https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/unaalmes-writeups
- Create a folder on your computer named as your user name and add all the files you would like to share there. 
It can contain your writeup on pdf or txt format as well as any other scripts used and you would like to share. 
- Use github web to navigate through writeups/challenge/episode
- Drag your directory into github

Example: We want to add a writeup to writeups/dragonball/episode3
